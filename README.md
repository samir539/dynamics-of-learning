# Dynamics of Learning and Iterated Games

This repository contains implementations of some of the most famous games within game theory along with an exploration of game theory in the context of learning agents and reinforcement learning. An in depth project investigation in the dynamics of learning within the context of the colonel Blotto game can be found as a pdf in the respository


## Game Theory and Learning Algorithms

## Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

The **Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma** is a classic game theory scenario where two players repeatedly choose to cooperate or defect. This scenario explores the tension between self-interest and cooperation over multiple interactions. Strategies like "Tit-for-Tat" and "Win-Stay, Lose-Shift" are used to analyze cooperative behavior.

## Q-learning

**Q-learning** is a foundational reinforcement learning algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal actions in an environment. It balances exploration and exploitation to gradually refine strategies based on cumulative rewards. Q-learning has applications in robotics, game AI, finance, and more.

## Regret Matching

**Regret Matching** is a concept used in game theory to model strategies that minimize regret associated with past actions. It allows players to adapt and improve strategies over time. This approach is powerful in analyzing scenarios like the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

## Two-Player Replicator Dynamics

**Two-Player Replicator Dynamics** explores the evolution of strategies in a population of two types of players. Strategies that yield higher payoffs become more prevalent over time. This concept provides insights into competitive and cooperative behaviors.

## Fictitious Play

**Fictitious Play** involves players repeatedly updating their strategies based on their beliefs about their opponent's actions. Over time, players converge towards stable strategies. Fictitious Play has applications in understanding strategic interactions and predicting opponents' behavior.

## Colonel Blotto Game

### Overview

The **Colonel Blotto Game** models competition over multiple battlefields with limited resources. In a scenario with five soldiers and three battlefields, players allocate soldiers to maximize their chances of winning each battlefield.

### Nash Equilibrium

**Nash Equilibrium** represents a stable state where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy, given their opponent's strategy. In Colonel Blotto, Nash Equilibrium involves allocating soldiers to maximize expected utility on all battlefields.

### Complexity and Applications

Calculating Nash Equilibrium in Colonel Blotto can be complex due to interactions between battlefields. The game has applications in military strategy, economics, and political science. It showcases the complexity of strategic decision-making.
